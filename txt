The distance between the patient and the camera was 150 cm for every patient. The patients were also informed to say “cheese” while the photographs were taking and the head would be placed in the esthetic position as recommend by Bass (a natural head position adjusted by clinician to assure that the face did not tilt up or down).19,20 For both lateral and oblique views, the patient’s Frankfort horizontal plane should be parallel to the floor and the right ear should be seen clearly.21 Eyes should be opened and looking straight.22 The point focus should be at the patient’s nose. For the lateral view photograph, the patient would be asked to bodily turn 90  to the left. The shot should be taken directly at 90  to the right side of patient’s face.22 The contralateral eyebrow should not be visible.23 For the oblique view photograph, the patient would be asked to turn from the profile photograph position slightly to their right (about 45  or 3/4 of the way) and the nose tip should be superimposed with the border of left cheek.22,23 The smile variables consisted of three types of measurements (angular, ratio, and numerical measurements) (see Figs. 2 and 3). When the alar-tragus line is five degrees downward, the Frankfurt plane will be parallel to the floor. A vertical line was drawn perpendicular to the horizontal plane and used as the vertical reference plane (Fig. 4). All linear variables will be evaluated as a ratio The reproducibility of the evaluation processwas evaluated by the same investigator, who remeasured 60 randomly selected images (20 fromeach group) after a 1-month interval using a Student’s t -test for paired samples. The absence of a significant difference (p< 0.05) between the two sets of measurements indicated agreement between them.
